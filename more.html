        The goal of this study is to create "Pubudu," one of the first
        machine learning-based and deep learning smartphone applications
        that support local languages for detecting and intervening in
        dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and dyslexia. Clinical studies and
        diagnostic procedures indicated by health professionals are used. To
        investigate spelling dysgraphia, dyslexia, and numerical dysgraphia,
        a deep neural network was deployed, and machine learning techniques
        were applied to detect dyscalculia. Intervention procedures are
        carried out in a gamified setting. The systemic test was performed
        on 50 handicapped children and 50 typical children. Diagnosis of
        statistical dysgraphia, dyslexia, and dysgraphia was performed with
        99 percent accuracy in dysgraphia, 88 percent accuracy in
        dysgraphia, and 58 percent accuracy in neural networks. A series of
        pronunciation tests were employed in this part to distinguish
        between non-dyslexic and dyslexic children. To begin, show a single
        Sinhala letter, like in. It is gradually enlarged to two words, as
        seen in. The convolutional neural network model was trained on 2,000
        children between the ages of 6 and 7. These variables are used to
        identify if the user has dyslexia or not. The probability of the
        spelled letters and words succeeding, the total number of
        successfully spelled letters and words, the total number of letters
        and words mispronounced, the total number of tries, and the time are
        the variables. This section contains several math examinations that
        assess a student's math abilities. This dyscalculia exam has three
        phases. depicts the first stage, which is to test computational
        ability, and depicts the second stage, which is to evaluate
        comparative ability. In the final phase, the basic math addition is
        checked. The model is built using the SVM technique

        <h3>4) Reducing reading disorder of dyslexia.</h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        Dyslexia is a language-based health illness defined by problems
        understanding specific words, mainly owing to insufficient
        phonological processing. The most serious dyslexia issues that
        damage one's reading abilities and short term memory. According to
        research among the characteristics of dyslexia are primarily word
        ambiguity, word processing, spelling, phonological, short term
        memory, and the ability to distinguish colors and shapes.
        Researchers have identified and decreased reading disorder in this
        aspect. The third aspect is "Dycalculia screening and treatment."
        Researchers have identified and decreased the mathematics disorder
        (difficulty with count, number analysis, and arithmetic adding) in
        this aspect. The fourth aspect is screening and treatment for letter
        dysgraphia (unclear, irregular, inconsistent handwriting). When kids
        succeed, these games get further advanced. Furthermore, this study
        has an accuracy rate of 89%. Arunalu Research, The objectives of
        this paper is to create a mobile application that will give a voice
        assistant can help dyslexic kids learn to read. This study focused
        on children aged 5â€“6 who were having difficulty reading Sinhala.
        This program uses machine learning to automate monitoring and
        treatment. The MFCC (Mel-frequency ceptral coefficients) approach
        was used for feature extraction, while CNN was used for model
        training. The accuracy was 72 percent, and it may be increased by
        giving more classification model to the neural network. This
        experiment has an average accuracy of 89 percent. There are four
        major aspects, as shown in Figure 1-2. "Vocal Pattern Analysis via
        Letters and Words" is the first aspect. This element screens and
        intervenes using an interactive gaming interface. The game
        periodically loads the grades of the user; hence the reading testing
        will go step by step. "Feature extraction from Sinhala letters by
        reading and speech pattern analysis" is the second aspect. This
        spect will give the screening and interventional technique in the
        form of a game. "Vocal pattern analysis using motion images" is the
        third component. After the user picks the degree of recognition, the
        system displays a basic motion picture in this aspect. The students
        should next read aloud the text in the motion graphics. "Screening
        and Intervention using Voice Pattern Analysis through Story Building
        Concept" is the fourth aspect. This part includes narrative and
        reading in order to improve children's overall reading ability.

      <p>
        There were some comparable articles that we consulted to gain an
        understanding of this topic. We recognised the majority of problems

      <h3>2) Treatment and reduction of color disorders.</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Individuals of all ages, from babies to the elderly, may be affected
        by a range of illnesses. According to estimates, dyslexia affect at
        least 10% of the world's population. In today's environment,
        learning disabilities are a sickness that is seldom discussed. They
        are physical ailments that are not apparent to the human eye, and
        some individuals are ignorant that they exist. Furthermore, the
        number of dyslexia-treatment methods is limited, and some may be
        unable to adequately address the issue. When it comes to our nation,
        we are dissatisfied with the work that has been done to solve the
        issue of LD detection. The number of research articles published
        regarding cognitive disorders in Sri Lanka is very low, according to
        a paper published in 2013 (8.6%). The majority of the time,
        elementary students are unable to operate an application that is
        written in English, and the accuracy of current apps may be
        insufficient. Furthermore, the majority of current applications are
        not customized to certain LDs. they built "Pubudu," the first
        smartphone application based on machine learning and deep learning
        to detect and intervene in dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia
        that supports native languages, in this study. The focus of this
        study is on identifying the disorder. For dyslexia, an accuracy of
        88% was achieved. However, these apps aren't focused on reducing
        color disorders. this application was intended to help people
        overcome reading difficulties in Sinhala. The purpose is to give
        phonological assistance to help children with impairments improve
        their reading skills by administering tests approved by a doctor.
        The reward is given at the conclusion of the test series to entice
        the child. Users and linked parties may also keep track of the
        user's progress. The major purpose of the suggested technique is to
        produce better and more efficient dyslexia early diagnostic testing
        and treatment procedures. , the goal of this research is to identify
        children who have certain learning problems and treat them using a
        mobile game. This testing procedure employs machine learning and
        deep learning techniques. To recognize the spoken letter or word on
        the mobile app, trained convolutional neural networks are utilized.
        ML methods such as k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support
        vector machine were used to create the models. For dyslexia, an
        accuracy of 89% was achieved. Because we are dealing with students,
        a mobile app rather than a desktop program may be the best choice
        for treating a disability. None of the available apps are designed
        to correct color disorder using speech recognition. The application
        may also attract schoolchildren since it uses the NAO robot to
        deliver feedback. Because colors may excite the brain to learn
        efficiently and understand information quickly, a mobile application
        is a highly engaging learning approach. More accurate and dependable
        convolutional neural networks approaches will power it. We use
        English as the major languages to optimize the app's usability. Our
        application, we hope, will assist children, teachers, doctors, and
        parents in minimizing the disorder of the learning disorders stated
        by incorporating these changes into current projects. Learning
        disabilities impact around 10% of the world's children. However, up
        to 20% of the worldwide people may exhibit certain symptoms
        Dyslexics have difficulty differentiating individual letters and
        individual words, detecting speech sounds, and decoding letters, as
        well as difficulties with comprehension, spelling, writing, and
        recognizing colors and forms. Dyslexics have difficulty
        differentiating individual letters and words, detecting speech
        sounds, and decoding letters, as well as issues with comprehension,
        spelling, and writing, as well as identifying colors and form The
        study's primary focus is on how to assess disability utilizing a
        mobile applicatio. However, most previous research hasn't focused on
        the symptoms of color misidentification disorder. No robot was used
        in earlier research efforts to observe the child's interaction.
        Because children with Dyslexia are naturally attracted to
        technology, robotic assistance is appropriate. Robots produce
        simpler feelings and are more predictable than humans. A convolution
        neural network is being used to solve this issue. The precision of
        the application will aid parents, teacher, doctor, and children in
        lowering the risk of this condition. Furthermore, via training, the
        solutions offered by this application help to reduce this issue in
        children. The application may also attract to schoolchildren since
        it uses the NAO robot to deliver feedback. Voice recognition
        technology combined with a Convolution Neural Network may quickly
        diagnose color disorders in dyslexics. Our application, we believe,
        will help children, teachers, physicians, and parents in reducing
        the disorder of the above learning disorders.

        <h3>4) Reducing reading disorder of dyslexia.</h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        A variation of learning disabilities can affect people of all ages,
        from babies to the aged. Dyslexia is one of the most common forms of
        learning impairments. Reading problems are common in 70-80% of
        persons with dyslexia. The research Gemified, in identifying the
        research need, The purpose of this study is to find children who
        have certain learning problems and treat them with a mobile game.
        They have mostly concentrated on diagnosis rather than treatment.
        They also did not place a high value on kid contact and interest.
        And they have only done study on the Sinhala language. They are
        particularly interested in dyslexic kids that struggle with reading
        in arunalu. Furthermore, in this research, they did not place a
        premium on kid contact or interest. Furthermore, they did their
        study entirely in Sinhala. The purpose of It Is Not the Robot Who
        Learns, It Is Me is to enhance the handwriting abilities of a kid
        with a complicated neurodevelopmental problem such as dyslexia. They
        employed a robot interface to train the handwriting abilities of
        dysgraphia kids. They did not, however, target dyslexic kids. They
        have concentrated on the kid who has difficulty handwriting,
        reading, and communicating in The hope. This approach exclusively
        enhances English writing, reading, and speaking. They mostly
        concentrate on the diagnoses over treatments. Furthermore, they did
        not highlight kid connection or motivation in this research.

        Students with disabilities are because of neurological issues.
        Although a child with learning disabilities may not be affected by
        his or her overall intelligence or desire, he or she may have
        difficulties in one or more areas of learning. When compared to kids
        who do not have challenges, children with impairments have lower or
        average IQs. The most frequent type of learning problem is dyslexia.
        It has several characteristics; 70-80% of those with dyslexia have
        difficulty reading. However, it can affect up to 20% of people
        worldwide. The main part of the research concentrates on how to cure
        disorder and what to do so using a mobile-android application and a
        humanoid-NAO robot. However, more previous initiatives have focused
        on identifying impairments rather than treating them. In addition,
        previous programs did not place a high value on kid connection and
        attention. Previously, no robot had been included in the contact
        with the kid in most study initiatives. Robot-assisted intervention
        is beneficial because children with dyslexia are naturally drawn to
        technology. In comparison to people and mobile applications,
        robotics provide simpler stimuli and are more predictable. As a
        result, we expect that by utilizing a robot, we will be able to cure
        kids who suffer from dyslexia.
